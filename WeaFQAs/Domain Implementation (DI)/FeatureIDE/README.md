# FeatureIDE
Some of the FQAs's artifacts implemented in FeatureIDE.

## Case Study
We have implemented the Authentication, Encryption, and Logging FQAs for an electronic voting (e-voting) application following several variability approaches supported by FeatureIDE.
These FQAs have been represented as feature, aspects, annotations, or a combination of them, based on the specific approach, and implemented as black boxs to fill with the desired framework/library third-party implementation.
