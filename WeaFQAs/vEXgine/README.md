# vEXgine
We have designed the software architecture of the **Authentication**, **Encryption**, and **Hashing** FQAs in UML.
We follow a negative variability approaches in which we part from the complete software architecture of the FQAs and remove those architectural elements not selected in a specific configuration (*resolution model*).
To do that, we provide the appropriate model transformations (e.g., *ObjectExistence*) to be executed by vEXgine.
We also provide the *variability model in CVL* of the security quality attribute.
