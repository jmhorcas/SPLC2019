# FeatureIDE
This contains the FQAs variability model in FeatureIDE as well as some of the FQAs's artifacts implemented in FeatureIDE.  
The variability model has been imported from S.P.L.O.T..

We have implemented the **Authentication**, **Encryption**, and **Logging** FQAs for an [electronic voting (e-voting)](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jss.2015.11.005) application following several variability approaches supported by FeatureIDE.
These FQAs have been represented as *feature*, *aspects*, *annotations*, or a combination of them, based on the specific approach, and implemented as black boxs to fill with the desired framework/library third-party implementation.

## Approaches
* Antenna (annotations)  
* Feature House and Java (Feature-Oriented Programming)  
* Feature House and AspectJ (Feature-Oriented Programming and Aspect-Oriented Programming)
